R comes with lots of great built-in functions like `r, eval=F, echo=T mean() `, `r, eval=F, echo=T sd() `, or `r, eval=F, echo=T median() `, but you may find the need for computations that do not have built-in functions. The good news is that you can create your own custom function that behaves and acts just like a built-in R function. 

To start one, you need the following structure: 

```{r}
myFunction = function(someLocalVariable) {
  
  ## your stuff can go here
  
}
```


Later, you can call your function later in your code the following ways: 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

myFunction(data)

```

or

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

apply(data, 2, myFunction)

```

# Exercises
1. Implement your own version of the mean function. Make sure its name is distinct from the built-in function's name
2. Implement a S.E.M. function
