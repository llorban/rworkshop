# What variables are in this dataset?


# How Many Total Trials (rows) are in the study?


# What is the maximum number of trials that one subject performed?


# Convert the Time trial to seconds, by dividing by 1000.


# What is the mean response time, across all trials?


# What percent of trials were answered correctly?


# What percent of trials were “Matching” trials?


# Is there a correlation between Angle of mental rotation and response time?


# Is there a response time difference between matching and nonmatching trials?


# Is there a response time difference between matching and nonmatching for different rotation Angles?


#  Is there a difference in accuracy between matching and non-matching trials?


# Plot the response time levels over Angle as a boxplot using the formula syntax
